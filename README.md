There are four sorter files that all implement the Sorter.java interface. InsertionSort.java creates InsertionSort objects that sort using Insertion sort. The three other sorter files are analagous. The instructions for MaretAlexanderSort are in the java header of the file.
SortTester.java contains tests for our sort objects. Each sorter has a sort tester file that implements these tests.
